# ANLY502 - Massive Data Fundamentals
This project is about the NYC TAXI DATASET using Spark/SparkSQL/Python. 

# ABSTRACT
In 2016, there were approximately 144 million taxi trips carried out by NYC yellow taxis throughout the city. 
Knowing where the pick-ups occur the most will likely increase a chance of picking up passengers, which will eventually 
lead to the higher earning potential for NYC yellow taxi drivers. In this paper, we explored the NYC taxi dataset and 
found the best hours, days, and months for NYC yellow cab drivers to work. We performed K-means clustering analysis 
on the entire dataset to find centroids, representing popular pick-up locations with a highest probability of pick-ups. 
In addition, we implemented a random forest model on the dataset and achieved a training accuracy of 99.10% 
and a test accuracy of 93.82%.
